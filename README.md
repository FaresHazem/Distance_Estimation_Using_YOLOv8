## Introduction

In this project, the goal is to implement a distance estimation system between a real-time camera and a designated 15x15 square, referred to as a "box," detected by the YOLOv8 model. The project showcases the practical application of object detection and distance estimation in a real-world scenario.

## Data Collection

For data collection, multiple datasets were created and experimented with to improve the quality of the dataset. The challenges faced and the final dataset selection are detailed in this section.

## YOLOv8 Model Training

The YOLOv8 model training involved experimentation with different models, data augmentation, and preprocessing techniques. The challenges faced and the optimization steps taken to achieve satisfactory results are documented.

## Applying YOLOv8 Model on Real-time Camera

After successfully training the YOLOv8 model, the next step involved applying the model to a real-time camera feed. Challenges and adjustments made during this process are discussed.

## Distance Estimation Algorithm Implementation

The distance estimation algorithm is implemented using a specific formula, and adjustments made to ensure accurate estimations are detailed. Initial tests and fine-tuning procedures are also discussed.

## Integration of All Components

This section covers the integration of the YOLOv8 algorithm, distance estimation formula, and real-time camera functionality. Challenges faced during integration and the steps taken to enhance user experience are documented.

## Project Structure

The project folder is named "Distance_Estimation_Using_YOLOv8" and consists of the following folders:
